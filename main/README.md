this program is a prototype of 3D-FDTD caliculation for a microspeaker model. I calculatated it under the condition below.
- CONDITION
Spatial step: x[0.0001], y[0.0001], z[0.00005] [m]
Time step: 0.00000001 [s]
Number of PML layers: 6
Degree M: 1.0
Point of calculation: 1[m] from the top of a hole
